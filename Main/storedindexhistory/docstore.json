If the lockout occurs during normal office hours, we will do our best to assist. If the lockout occurs outside office hours, you will have to contact a roommate or locksmith to provide access. You should keep a copy of the key accessible and outside the bedroom at all times. You will be billed for any damages that arise due to a lockout and/or the installation of your own hardware. Think kicking the door down is a good idea? Replacement costs on bedroom doors/frames range from $300-$600, depending on the type of door. A locksmith is much cheaper!  Parties \u2013 Keg parties are against the law and absolutely not permitted in our buildings. You should keep any other gatherings you wish to have well under control and ensure your guests follow physical distancing protocols. You, as the Tenant, are fully responsible for any of your Guests\u2019 behavior. Any vandalism that occurs to a building, even if you are unaware of it, the damage will be charged to you if you are having a party. This includes, but is not limited to, damage in hallways, litter and broken glass and pulled fire alarms. Know your Guests, and control your Guests. Anywhere outside of your apartment is a public space. As such, you may be fined by police if you are found outside of the apartment with open alcohol. Avoid the risk and keep your drinks in your apartment!   Roommate Problems \u2013 Disagreements, arguments and/or conflict will sometimes occur between roommates, whether you are living with friends or strangers. Our housing is not residence and we encourage residents to work out their differences/issues themselves. Any issues ought to be discussed between parties/roommates in order to attempt to find compromise and resolution. In the event that you are unable to resolve the problem, please feel free to contact Resident Services for advice if needed.   Some general rules to ensure include; cleaning up after yourself, asking for permission before using other roommate\u2019s belongings, communicating with roommates regarding if you will be having guests or need some quiet time (ie studying for exams).   We recommend using the provided \u201cRoommate Agreement\u201d to build consensus amongst your group about the rules and responsibilities of the group so that expectations are in writing for future reference, if need be.     Cleaning \u2013 Tenants are responsible for general cleaning and upkeep of their apartment. Common areas are to be always kept clean. Bedrooms must be kept to a reasonable level of cleanliness.   New leases will typically include a monthly cleaning service for all common areas of the apartment. Your bedroom will still be your responsibility, as will all laundry, dishes, and garbage removal. You will receive written notice of scheduling for the service shortly after move-in. At the time of move-in your apartment will be clean.  The monthly cleaning service will include the following: - Living room: vacuuming and dusting of supplied furniture - Kitchen: mopping floors, wipe down all cabinets, countertops and appliances - Bathrooms: mopping floors, wipe down of all vanities/counters, toilets and shower", "start_char_idx": 4, "end_char_idx": 3234, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5039c526-54ec-49ca-87eb-0def83b9f7e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "5039c526-54ec-49ca-87eb-0def83b9f7e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "tenantNotice.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8f1af009-d5e3-4025-a327-05dc22e6065d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "tenantNotice.pdf"}, "hash": "c6da19bf90cff7377336260ab8f3fe7b7c6627c48b5bbaa79224ea0390d5a49b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3730d074-0684-4732-b9e1-a15f2dec74a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "tenantNotice.pdf"}, "hash": "2819e2c168db244edae9456aabdbbc89cc29ddcb25893e03eb2eb1b07a1c0872", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ead3c3d-5fb5-45f9-a46d-4fdd1c1a75c3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "42087895cdf95119361778e869d00a279602be10f3271254ee5cd6ec3048f41c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "35a2fed385e38e926ca0ed3548c3da8d285770dcfec65bd4de4d8bfa8f446f09", "text": "Please keep in mind that you are required to ensure your apartment is prepared for this service, including keeping the apartment in a reasonable state of cleanliness.

Any cleaning deemed more than reasonable levels will be billed at an hourly rate of $60/hr and billed back to the residents of the apartment.    Toilets/Drains \u2013 Tenants are responsible for dealing with clogged toilets. Every apartment should have a toilet plunger (get one right away if you don\u2019t have one!). If damage is caused as a result of a toilet overflow that could have been prevented, you will be billed for any damages. Do not flush feminine hygiene products down the toilet - it can lodge in the drain and require a plumber to fix the issue which will be billed to your unit (approx.$300). CLICK HERE for a Youtube video explaining how to properly plunge a clogged toilet. ***After attempting to unclog the toilet/drain, if you are not successful, please feel free to submit a maintenance ticket through your Yuhu portal. Do not use drain-cleaning products, such as Draino, in any sink or shower \u2013 they can cause further problems and usually have limited effect. If you have a clogged sink/shower drain, please submit a maintenance request and we will take care of the issue for you!

Tenants that leave garbage in the hallways/outside your unit will be billed $5/bag cleanup charges (with a minimum charge of $20).  Guests \u2013 A guest is someone who visits you temporarily. Any resident can have guests visit; there are no sign-ins required. You are fully responsible/liable for any of your guests\u2019 behaviour. Should your guest cause any damages or negatively affect the reasonable enjoyment of other residents, you will be held liable for costs and could possibly face eviction.   Please keep in mind that there is a distinction between guests and occupants. If your guest is staying for days on end, or keeps personal belongings in your unit, they essentially become an occupant of the apartment. Unless written permission is first obtained from property management, any occupants who are not lease holder will be considered unauthorized and could result in eviction of the leaseholder.   ***Public Health guidelines may supersede these policies throughout the pandemic (ie. during previous lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, visitors were restricted by household).    Pets \u2013 Written permission from management is necessary prior to bringing a pet into your apartment. This allows management to ensure there are no roommates with allergies. If you bring a pet into a unit where other roommates have allergies, you will be asked to remove the pet or face eviction. Should you bring a pet, be sure to clean up after them and do not let them bother your neighbours. Any damage they cause will be billed to the owner. We will demand that you remove the pet if it is causing damage or affecting the reasonable enjoyment of your neighbours.   Bikes \u2013 Bikes can be locked to the railings behind the buildings.

Please DO NOT do this! Turning off the furnace may result in the freezing and bursting of the water pipes, which could cause a flood in your unit and neighbouring units. Damages can easily amount to thousands of dollars in repairs. Please turn the thermostat down to a minimum of 16\u00b0C (61\u00b0F) to prevent freezing, but DO NOT TURN THE FURNACE OFF!
